### Task 1 
N positive integers are entered from the standard input and are stored in an array (N <100). All elements that meet the next criteria should be presented on the standard output in the same order that they have appeared on the standard input. The criteria is following: the most important digit (the digit on the first place) is odd and the least important digit is even. If, no such number was entered, you should print out "No such elements!" message.

The implementation of checking the criteria should be performed in a separate function (recursive function for additional 5 points).

### Task 2

Read the dimensions M and N (not bigger than 100) and the values (whole numbers) of one matrix A_ {MxN} from the standard input. Print out the index of the first column that has the smallest sum of all of its elements.

### Task 3

A text file "input.txt" consist of digits and letters. The number of digits and letters in a row is limited to 80. Write a program that for every row will print out the letters concatenated next to each other first followed by the sum of all numbers that appear in that row. If there are no digits in the row, for the sum of the numbers you should print out 0.

Example:  For the text file:

y2d3vbqiiK064waaa    
ksdjdjgdjgHH
the output is following:

ydvbqiiKwaaa69
ksdjdjgdjgHH0
